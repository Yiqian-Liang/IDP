# IDP
What we had done so far:
- We have completed the classes&methods for the components(e.g. motor, line sensor etc) as well as the testing
- We have completed the line following&navigation function
- We have done the testing for the line following&rotation function
- We have completed the navigation route from Depo1 to A/B/C/D(may need refinement)
Future tasks:
- Navigation function testing&add more routes for completion(Depo2 and going back function)
- work on the position of the line sensors
- integrate with QRCode reader and Distance Sensor
- work on grabbing and dropping off the box(may need mechanical team help)
- refine the navigation algorithm&rotation function to make it more efficient/fexible
- may change functions to classes for better organization(OOP)?#for further discussion
